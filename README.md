### Our dataset consists of credit card transactions made by users. In this project, I will examine the relevant dataset and develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.
### In this project, I used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM models.
